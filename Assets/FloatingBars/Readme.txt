After installing the asset, a new 'Floating Bars' item is added under 'Tools' in your menu bar allowing to create, edit or destroy a floating bar.

To create a new Floating bar, click on Floating Bars -> Open Creator, a new window will open, in this window you can :

- Name your Floating bar
- Attach it to a gameObject (recommanded ...)
- Add an existing Float Variable or create a new one (Example of variables are given in 'ScriptableObjects Example' directory)
- Add a minimum and maximum Float Variable (still with a Float Variable)
- Add a regen rate Float Variable
- Give a position for the bar

Once 'Mandatory Settings' are filled you can click on 'Add New Floating Bar' button, and that's it, you have your first Floating Bar !

To Edit a Floating Bar, Select the desired Floating Bar in your Hierarchy and go to 'Floating Bars' menu, then 'Edit Bar'. Now you should see the original bar settings but if you change values, your bar will automatically change in your scene allow you to fine tune your bar.
